# school-voting-program.cpp
Created for igcse cie (0478) cs pre-release from paper 2 variant 1 in c++ purely for fun.<br/>
Code is a little messy and spagetti as i rarely write in c/c++.

### Build
This was built and tested only on linux (Ubuntu 20.4). Uses C++17 (g++ toolchain). You can download, compile and run it if you are using any other unix or linux based systems (mac os, ubuntu, mint, etc..):
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cryptidv/school-voting-program.cpp.git && g++ main.cpp -std=c++17 -o program.out && ./program.out
```
###### Note: The above assumes you have the g++ toolchain installed on your system.
<br>
This is a completely useless program and I probably wont use it in the exam, but why not?
<br>
Also please note that this was never compiled and tested on windows, and owing to the fact that I used a ton of bash color-codes, it'll probably look like a mess.. (though i have no idea if windows command prompt can properly display bash color-codes..)
<br>
If you do want to run this on windows you'll need [visual studio c++ stuff](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus) downloaded..
